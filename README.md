# Number Guessing Game

A desktop GUI application implementing a number guessing game using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Overview

This application generates a random integer between 1 and 10 and challenges the user to guess the correct number. The program provides interactive feedback to guide the user toward the correct answer and tracks the number of attempts required to solve the puzzle.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language
- **tkinter**: Built-in Python GUI toolkit for cross-platform desktop application development
- **random module**: Standard library module for pseudorandom number generation

### Architecture
The application follows an event-driven programming model with the following components:

- **Main Window**: Root tkinter window container with minimum dimensions of 200x40 pixels
- **Input Field**: Entry widget for user number input with Enter key binding
- **Feedback Display**: Label widget providing dynamic response text
- **Control Buttons**: Action buttons for guess submission and application termination
- **Game Logic**: Global state management for attempt tracking and number comparison

### Key Features
- Random number generation within configurable range (currently 1-10)
- Real-time input validation and feedback system
- Attempt counter with final score display
- Keyboard shortcut support (Enter key for guess submission)
- Clean, minimalist user interface design

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.x installation
- tkinter library (included with most Python distributions)

### Dependencies
No external dependencies required. The application uses only Python standard library modules:
```python
import tkinter as tk
import random
```

## Usage

### Running the Application
Execute the main Python file to launch the GUI:
```bash
python testtkinter.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions
1. Launch the application to display the game window
2. Enter a numerical guess (1-10) in the input field
3. Click "Guess" button or press Enter to submit
4. Follow the directional feedback ("higher" or "lower")
5. Continue guessing until the correct number is found
6. View final attempt count upon successful completion
7. Click "quit" to terminate the application

## Code Structure

The application implements a simple callback-based event system:
- `check_guess()`: Primary game logic function handling user input validation, number comparison, and UI updates
- Global variables manage game state including the target number and attempt counter
- Event bindings connect user interactions to corresponding handler functions

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- Configurable difficulty levels with extended number ranges
- High score persistence and leaderboard functionality  
- Enhanced input validation and error handling
- Improved visual design with themed UI components
- Sound effects and animations for user feedback
